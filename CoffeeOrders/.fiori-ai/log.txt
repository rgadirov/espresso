==========LLM call for step "extractAppSkeleton":==========
You help the user building a Fiori Elements application described in the user input.

A Fiori Elements application typically starts with a ListReport page showing the data of the base entity of the application in a table.
Details of a specific table row are shown in the ObjectPage. This first ObjectPage is therefore based on the base entity of the application.
An ObjectPage can contain one or more table sections based on to-many associations of its entity type.
The details of a table section row can be shown in an another ObjectPage based on the associations target entity.

Your task is to find the entities (with their to-many associations) as well as the ObjectPages (with the to-many associations they use in table sections) described in the user input below.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:
```json

==========LLM call for classifier:==========
The user input below describes a Fiori Elements application with a ListReport page and multiple ObjectPages.
ListReport page shows the data of the specific business object as a list or table. ObjectPage shows details of a specific business object instance.
Your task is to classify the lines based on the same business object representation to the following categories, one line can refer only to a single category:
 - LIST_REPORT_COFFEEORDERS: line describes the ListReport page for "CoffeeOrders"
 - OBJECT_PAGE_COFFEEORDERS: line describes the ObjectPage for "CoffeeOrders"
 - NONE: line is not describing any ListReport page or ObjectPage

Return your findings as csv file with columns "lineContent" and "category"!

<UserInput>
Generate a SAP CAP app based fiori elements app for corresponding data model.
A list report with navigation to header information.

entity CoffeeOrders {
 key ID : UUID;
 customerName : String;
 coffeeType : Association to CoffeeTypes;
 orderTime : Timestamp;
 status : String enum { Ordered; InPreparation; Ready; PickedUp };
}

entity CoffeeTypes {
 key ID : UUID;
 name : String;
 price : Decimal(5,2);
}
</UserInput>

----------Response:----------
To classify the lines based on the given categories, we need to analyze the user input and determine which lines correspond to the ListReport page for "CoffeeOrders" and which correspond to the ObjectPage for "CoffeeOrders". Here is the classification:

```csv
lineContent,category
"Generate a SAP CAP app based fiori elements app for corresponding data model.",NONE
"A list report with navigation to header information.",LIST_REPORT_COFFEEORDERS
"entity CoffeeOrders {",NONE
"key ID : UUID;",NONE
"customerName : String;",NONE
"coffeeType : Association to CoffeeTypes;",NONE
"orderTime : Timestamp;",NONE
"status : String enum { Ordered; InPreparation; Ready; PickedUp };",NONE
"}",NONE
"entity CoffeeTypes {",NONE
"key ID : UUID;",NONE
"name : String;",NONE
"price : Decimal(5,2);",NONE
"}",NONE
```

Explanation:
- The line "A list report with navigation to header information." is classified as `LIST_REPORT_COFFEEORDERS` because it describes a list report page with navigation, which aligns with the ListReport page for "CoffeeOrders".
- The other lines do not specifically describe a ListReport or ObjectPage for "CoffeeOrders" and are therefore classified as `NONE`.

==========LLM call for step "extractListReport":==========
A Fiori Elements Application has the following pages:
 - ListReport page for "CoffeeOrders"
 - ObjectPage for "CoffeeOrders"

Available entities with their associations and elements are:
Entity "CoffeeOrders"
   Properties:
       customerName: Name of the customer placing the order
       orderTime: Timestamp of when the order was placed
       status: Current status of the order; possible values: Ordered, InPreparation, Ready, PickedUp
   Associations:
       coffeeType: association to many entities CoffeeTypes
Entity "CoffeeTypes"
   Properties:
       name: Name of the coffee type
       price: Price of the coffee type
   Associations:
       coffeeOrders: association to single entity CoffeeOrders

The user input below describes the details of the ListReport page (i.e. its filters, tables or views with their columns).

Your task is to help the user defining the ListReport page.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:

==========LLM call for step "extractColors":==========
You help the user creating a Fiori Elements application based on user input describing such an application.
Your task is to determine whether the entity properties can be considered good and bad in most contexts or are usually neutral. When in doubt, set to neutral.

These are the entity properties and their values:
Entity: CoffeeOrders, Property: status, Values: Ordered, InPreparation, Ready, PickedUp

If the properties can be considered good and bad, the allowed values for their criticality and the associated colors are:
   negative: red
   critical: yellow or orange
   positive: green
   neutral:  grey

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:

==========LLM call for data generation:==========

For the following list of entities, create data for the empty CSV files.
Entity "CoffeeOrders" - Properties:
    customerName: String(255), Name of the customer placing the order
    orderTime: Timestamp, Timestamp of when the order was placed
    status: String(20), Current status of the order; possible values: Ordered, InPreparation, Ready, PickedUp

Entity "CoffeeTypes" - Properties:
    name: String(255), Name of the coffee type
    price: Decimal, Price of the coffee type
    coffeeOrders_customerName: String(255), customerName of associated CoffeeOrders

Empty CSV files in json format (only generate content for these files!):
{"CoffeeOrders.csv":"customerName;orderTime;status","CoffeeTypes.csv":"name;price;coffeeOrders_customerName"}

Rules:
    - Take over the given header line, do not invent new columns!
    - For a given file, add rows, add '\n' characters before each row but don't break the JSON string
    - Do not generate rows with same key values, they must be unique!
    - Make sure that associations match, i.e. a field containing "Name of the associated Customer" must contain an existing Name of entity Customer
    - Always use ";" as a delimiter in CSV files
    - The result must be proper JSON format so it can be parsed, don't break JSON strings within, don't add quotes around values.
    - Create about 5 rows for the first csv, 7 for the second and so on
    - All values must be realistic with meaningful content, e.g. 'Laptop Screen' and not just placeholder values with incremented numbers like 'Product 1', 'Product 2' etc.
    
Use format for values:
  String(50): string no longer than 50 characters
  Decimal(3,2): 1.23
    
For the following fields, use only the supplied allowed values (as they are, don't insert spaces or change case):
- status (of CoffeeOrders): Ordered, InPreparation, Ready, PickedUp

Example output (Do NOT include in output!):
